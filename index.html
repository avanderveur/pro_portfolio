        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Aundria Vanderveur, a passionate problem solver with a background shaped by both military service and academic achievements.
            When I first got out of the Marine Corps, I went straight to college and earned my BA in Psychology from San Jose State University.
            I have completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera, the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, and a cybersecurity boot camp in Aug 2023, receiving my Agile Professional Certificate.
            During my service in the Marine Corps, I was a 0411 Maintenance Management Specialist, responsible for managing equipment databases and reporting mission readiness.
            I have a strong interest in problem-solving, and I use tools like VS Code, GitHub, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and cybersecurity tasks.
            I completed the IBM Data Science Capstone, and my goal is to be employed by a company where I can continue learning and growing.
            I am a problem solver, ambitious, and a continuous and quick learner.
        </p>
